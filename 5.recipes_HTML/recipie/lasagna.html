    <p class="paragraph">
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers wide, flat pasta with rich
      meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and gooey mozzarella. This particular
      recipe, known as the "World's Best Lasagna," is a fan favorite for its
      hearty and satisfying flavors. It features a robust meat sauce made with
      sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef, combined with onions, garlic,
      and a blend of tomato products. The sauce is seasoned with fresh parsley,
      dried basil, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and a touch of sugar for
      balance.

      a ricotta cheese mixture (enhanced with an egg for binding), and slices of
      mozzarella. The dish is topped with grated Parmesan cheese and baked to
      perfection. The result is a comforting, flavorful meal that's perfect for
